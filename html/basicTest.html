			<h1>Introduction</h1>

			<p>Multidrug-resistant microorganisms are on the rise due to over administration of antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), about 25 000 patients die each year from infections caused by selected multidrug-resistant bacteria in the European Union (EU) alone. However, this number is an underestimate of the scope of the problem because it is not isolated to just the EU. It’s a global problem, and only increases with the overuse of antibiotics. This project will target the detection of yeast infections. The CDC claims that it is difficult to quantify how many people acquire yeast infections. One reason for this may be because the most common ways to detect yeast infections is self-diagnosis for yeast infection-like symptoms where the patient goes to see their doctor.  The common treatment for yeast infection-like symptoms is to simply buy topical antibiotics as over-the-counter drugs. This method is highly inaccurate. Therefore, some patients could be taking antibiotics even though they are not infected. This overuse of antibiotics promotes resistant microorganisms like yeast to become more prominent and harder to combat.
			 
			This causes some individuals to be treated with antibiotics or antifungal medication when they actually aren’t infected. Therefore, there is an over administration of these medications, which increases their input in the environment and ultimately to multidrug-resistant pathogens. These types of microorganisms become more difficult to combat because of their resistance to common treatment methods. The development of more accurate and definitive testing of these infections will allow for a more accurate diagnosis, a decrease in the over administration of antibiotics, and a decrease in the development of multidrug-resistant organisms, which will allow current treatment methods to remain viable to those patients in need. 
			</p>
			<h1> Current Tests </h1>
			<p>
			A diagnostic test capable of detecting the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans has the potential to decrease patient suffering while simultaneously reducing the spread of antibiotic resistance. Although such tests exist for the diagnosis of both blood borne and mucosal Candidiasis, both are lacking in several respects. To diagnose vulvovaginal Candidiasis, the most common form of mucosal Candidiasis, current store bought tests use a pH based indicator. While accurate, pH imbalances are also indicative of a host of other problems and thus produce false positives. For a more definitive diagnosis, patients can either subject themselves to a manual inspection of the afflicted area from a specialized doctor or wait for lab technicians to collect a sample of discharge and identify yeast microbes under a microscope; both require an unnecessary amount of time, money, and effort from the patient. To diagnose blood borne Candidiasis, current tests are culture based and can take over 7 days to complete. Given the lethality of blood borne Candidiasis, such a time requirement is unacceptable.

			More as an indicator, there are two common causes of yeast-infection-like symptoms. There is bacterial vaginosis  and yeast infections. A pH test is done as a bacterial infection will commonly increase the pH, while a yeast infection will not have a change in pH. Therefore, this test is not even really checking for a yeast infection. It simply rules out bacterial vaginosis. The person may have bad allergies or is sensitive which may cause similar symptoms to a degree. Also, there are many different things that can cause a rise in pH that are not necessarily bacterial base which can cause a person to buy antibiotics when they aren’t dealing with bacteria. Many STI’s cause a pH imbalance, as well as Hemorrhoids. Also, there are also non-infectious circumstances that can lead to diagnosis of a bacterial infection, when it is in fact a yeast infection. This includes doing the test within two days from douching, doing the test during a period, or within 5 days of a period, doing the test within two days after having sex, if you are pregnant, or going through menopause, or currently nursing, or doing the test within 72 hours of applying a vaginal cream. This situation attributes even more to the growing problem of pathogens becoming antibiotic resistant as it can cause people to get antibiotics for their symptoms when it is likely a yeast infection where antibiotics would do nothing but kill the helpful bacteria in the environment.

			<h1>The YEasy Kit </h1>

					<p>
					The main project goal is to create a diagnostic tool capable of detecting excessive amounts of Candida albicans, an opporun a construct that will detect yeast infections caused by Candida albicans, a yeast species commonly involved in human yeast infections. There are two forms of C. albicans, bloodborne and mucosal, referred to as white and opaque respectively. The white form is very invasive and develops the ability to move through skin and infect many areas having a lethality rate of an estimated 38%-49%(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3165445/). The opaque form is much more common however and is highly reproductive. 

					The two different forms of Candida albicans emit two different biomolecules. The white form produces farnesol. The opaque form produces tyrosol. These molecules interact with Pqsr and Tyrosinase respectively and we will be splitting these different proteins such that in the presence of the biomolecules a full protein will be formed. However, in order to produce a response that is visible we will also be splitting HRP, a protein catalyst for many reactions. The specific reaction is with TMB and HRP that will form Blue Substrate that is visible in high concentrations. We will label each half of the split Pqsr and Tyrosinase with one half of the HRP, such that the coupling of the pqsr will in a way catalyze the coupling of HRP allowing it to catalyze the reaction with TMB.

					The final product will consist of two different detection constructs that follow the same mechanism as modified from(From.above info). One will require a blood sample that will test for the existence of white form yeast, while the other will require a mucosal swab to detect the opaque form. The way that the devices will work is if the associated reporter molecule is detected by the device. HRP will couple and react with TMB to produce a visible Blue Substrate. This will mean that a high amount of yeast is existent meaning a strong likelihood of an infection with the corresponding symptoms.
