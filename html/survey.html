					<h1>Survey Distribution</h1>

					<p>Still, Amazon Mechanical Turk was chosen as a survey distribution method due to it being a fairly cheap, non-labor intensive way to achieve a large sample size without relying upon a convenience sample.</p>

					<h1>Yeast ID Marketability</h1>
					<p>As our detection system is designed to be an over-the-counter (OTC) diagnostic test, we wanted to assess the marketplace and demand for this style of diagnosis. While diagnosis by a healthcare professional was the most preferred option, with 42% of people selecting it as their first-choice diagnostic method, 35% of people selected over-the-counter tests as their preferred diagnostic method, and 51% of people selected it as their second-choice diagnostic method, making it the overall second-choice diagnostic method. As such, due to the prevalence of yeast infections, there seems to be a market for OTC tests, like the one we are creating. All of the people who ranked “other” highly described their “other” option as alternative, “natural” diagnosis methods and treatments. While the over-the-counter was not the most-preferred diagnostic method, there is still a large enough market to justify a demand for testing products such as our own.</p>

					<p>A total of 29 people listed not seeking an official diagnosis, and trends in their responses as to why that is there preferred method were analyzed. Nine major themes were apparent in their answers, and about half of them believed that it was easy to diagnose yeast-infections based on symptoms or by consulting online resources and forums. 14% of people wanted to go right to self-treating with over-the-counter products. 10% of people included in their response either that seeking a diagnosis was embarrassing or that they liked the privacy involved in self-diagnosis. </p>

					<p>A total of 49 people selected that they preferred using over-the-counter diagnostic tests, and the trends for the reason for their preference was analyzed. 33% of respondents listed the convenience and ease-of-use as reasons why they preferred OTC-diagnoses, with 10% mentioning that OTC-tests were quick or that they thought they would have to wait too long to see a doctor. 12% of people just responded generically that they liked how OTC-tests prevented them from needing to see a doctor, with an additional 6% of people who prefer OTC-diagnostic tests specifying that they believe that it is embarrassing to see a doctor for their yeast infection and 14% liking the privacy of OTC tests. An additional 24% of people preferred OTC-tests due their low cost and the high costs associated with doctors visits. 14% indicated that they like using OTC tests when they already suspect the issue is a yeast infection, and just want to confirm this belief. </p>
					<div class="spacer-extrasmall"></div>
					<img class="center" style="width:50%;" src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/6/6e/T--Purdue--rasonsOtc.png"/>
					<div class="spacer-extrasmall"></div>
					<p>Overall, the trends in reasons for preferring certain diagnosis options indicates a need for further education on yeast infections and the risks associated with self-diagnosing and abuse of antifungal creams, as well as a need to end the stigma associated with yeast infections. While getting doctors to support our OTC-test and its accuracy would help, we should have a market as long as our product is easy-to-use, cheap, and quick.</p>

					<h1>Integration into Paper Assay Design</h1>
					<h3>Our survey was designed to establish the following design criteria.</h3>

					<img class="center" style="width:50%;" src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/8/8c/T--Purdue--waitTimes.png"/>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Our test must take less than 30 minutes to achieve a result.</p>
					<div class="spacer-small"></div>
					<img class="center" style="width:50%;" src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/4/48/T--Purdue--cost.png"/>
					<p style="text-align:center;">Our test must cost less than $10.</p>

					<p style="text-align:center;">Our test kits should allow for consumers to analyze two individual swabs to ensure their confidence in their diagnosis.</p>
					<div class="spacer-small"></div>
					<p>We also asked the survey respondents if they had any concerns with our proposed product, and discovered the following.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Test accuracy should be greater than 90%.</li>
						<li>With an internal expiration spot on the test strip, there is concern as to buying a test and then discovering it is expired. A solution for this could occur in our packaging, with an amber cellophane window on the packaging allowing customers to view the expiration spot.</li>
						<li>Over time, the negative control will also react and become blue. There is concern about knowing the optimal time to view the test result.</li>
						<li>Interpreting the test requires comparing the degree of blue of the test spot, negative control, and positive control. There is concern about how accurately users would be able to do so with their naked eyes.</li>
						<li>There are four different spots (expiration, test sample, positive control, and negative control) that can turn blue. There is some concern over properly identifying which spot is which.</li>
					</ul>
