a brief description of important files

Important HTML files
NavBarBoot.html - has the structure for the navigation menu and needed links - prefer if you don't edit without asking as a lot going on
footer.html - has the footer structure - I'll prob tweak it for better mobile support
basicTest.html - is the standard layout for one of our pages - I test out different features on here
basicTest2.html - same as above but was trying something different on it
notebookTest.html - has test stuff for notebook page as it has some special features, mainly the additional side menu that should be applicable to other pages once ready
test.html - is for the main page - needs work to move off of stylings offered by iGEM and for better mobile support

Important CSS files
NavBarBoot.css - is the general style sheet used for all pages, not just the navigation menu
StyleSheet.css - the wiki version of NavBarBoot.css. Sometimes when moving things to wiki, they don't turn out as pretty, so i put necessary changes in here so that it separates the wiki and local stylesheets
StandardStyling.css - the stylesheet provided by iGEM. I used some of it for the main page but is proving to be difficult to use. Instead, just use custom stylings in NavBarBoot.css and bootstrap

Important folder
bootrap - this folder holds the bootstrap javascript, jQuery, and CSS files. Link to these. Ignore the other bootstrap folder

Garbage files/folders
bootstrap-4.0.0-dist - tried to get bootstrap locally - failed attempt
glyphicons - tried to get twitter and facebook icon from it but sucks
pretty much everything else except images is worthless
